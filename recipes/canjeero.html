    <h1>Canjeero</h1>
    <img src="img/canjeero.jpg" alt="canjeero" height="310" width="310" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Canjeero</strong> is typically made from a batter consisting of
      flour (often a combination of wheat flour and sometimes corn flour or
      millet flour), water, and a small amount of yeast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, a portion of the batter is saved from a previous batch to
      ferment and provide a sourdough-like flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup corn flour (optional, for texture)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>Oil or ghee (clarified butter) for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, corn flour, yeast,
        sugar, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add lukewarm water while stirring to form a smooth batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment at room temperature for at
        least 6 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with oil or
        ghee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the fermented batter and pour a ladleful onto the skillet,
        spreading it thinly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for 1-2 minutes until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and
        cook the other side until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet between each
        Canjeero.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm with honey, ghee, yogurt, or alongside Somali stews (maraq).
