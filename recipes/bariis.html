    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Bariis and Suqaar</strong> is a traditional Somali dish that
      combines fragrant rice (bariis) with tender, spiced meat (suqaar). This
      dish is a staple in Somali cuisine and is cherished for its rich flavors
      and comforting qualities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rice is typically cooked with a blend of spices such as turmeric,
      cumin, and cardamom, giving it a vibrant yellow color and a subtle
      aromatic taste. The suqaar, which is diced meat (often beef or lamb), is
      seasoned with garlic, onions, and a variety of spices before being sauteed
      until tender.

      <strong>Bariis and Suqaar</strong> is often served with a side of banana,
      salad, or a spicy chutney, adding layers of flavor and texture to the
      meal. It is enjoyed during festive occasions, family gatherings, and
      everyday meals, reflecting the cultural richness and hospitality of
      Somalia.

    <h3>For Bariis (Rice)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the rice and stir

      </li>
      <li>
        Add the turmeric, ground cumin, and crushed cardamom pods to the rice.
        Stir for about 1 minute to toast the spices.
      </li>
      <li>Pour in the water and add salt to taste. Bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the
        rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it
        sit, covered, for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.
